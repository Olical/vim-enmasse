{"name":"vim-enmasse","tagline":"Edit every file in a quickfix list at the same time.","body":"# En Masse [![Build Status][travis-image]][travis] [![Stories in Ready][waffle-image]][waffle]\r\n\r\nTakes a quickfix list and makes it editable. You can then write each change back to their respective files using your favourite way of writing files, `:w` or `ZZ`, for example. Fix multiple [JSHint][] issues at once or perform a complex find and replace across your project all within the comfort of Vim.\r\n\r\n![Animated demonstration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Wolfy87/vim-enmasse/master/images/example.gif)\r\n\r\n## Using the plugin\r\n\r\nAs you can see in the demonstration above, all you have to do is populate a quickfix list in some way (I used [JSHint][], but you could use [Ag][], for example), then execute `:EnMasse`. This will open a new buffer with each line corresponding to a line in the quickfix list.\r\n\r\nYou can then edit each line in any way you want. When done just write this magical buffer and it will update each line in their corresponding files. For more information, check out [the documentation!][docs]\r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n\r\nTests are performed using [vader][], to pull the dependencies and run them simply execute `./tests/run`. The tests are automatically executed by [TravisCI][] too, so keep an eye on that if you push changes or open a PR. The badge up the top of this README indicates the state of master, it should ALWAYS be green. A test should be written before any change is made.\r\n\r\n## Author\r\n\r\n[Oliver Caldwell][] / [@OliverCaldwell][]\r\n\r\n## Unlicence\r\n\r\nThis is free and unencumbered software released into the public domain.\r\n\r\nAnyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use, compile, sell, or\r\ndistribute this software, either in source code form or as a compiled\r\nbinary, for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, and by any\r\nmeans.\r\n\r\nIn jurisdictions that recognize copyright laws, the author or authors\r\nof this software dedicate any and all copyright interest in the\r\nsoftware to the public domain.
