Introduction                                       *enmasse* *enmasse-introduction*

Takes a |quickfix| list and makes it editable. You can then write each change
back to their respective files using your favourite way of writing files, |:w| or
|ZZ|, for example. Fix multiple JSHint issues at once or perform a complex find
and replace across your project all within the comfort of Vim.

===============================================================================
Usage                                                             *enmasse-usage*

All you have to do is populate a quickfix list in some way (using JSHint or Ag,
for example), then execute :EnMasse. This will open a new buffer with each line
corresponding to a line in the quickfix list.

You can then edit each line in any way you want. When done just write this
magical buffer and it will update each line in their corresponding files. Do
not delete any lines, that will not work and EnMasse will actually prevent you
from writing if you've added or removed any lines.

The biggest caveat right now is that each line will be written one after the
other, even if the same line shows up in the quickfix list twice. So you could
see the same line multiple times in the EnMasse buffer, but only the last one
will actually make it's way into the finished file.

===============================================================================
Quickfix hints                                           *enmasse-quickfix-hints*

As you move your cursor through the lines the matching quickfix entry message
will be echoed at the bottom of the screen. So if you're scrolling through a
buffer created from a JSHint quickfix list, you'll be provided with the
corresponding JSHint message for each line at the bottom of the window.
